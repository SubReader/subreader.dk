      "title": "What is dyslexia and who has it?",
      "p1": "There are often many questions that arise when you find out that you or someone in your family is dyslexic. For many, dyslexia is detected at an early age when reading and writing difficulties become apparent when they start school. But for others, dyslexia is only discovered much later, and it can be a challenge to follow the teaching and entertainment like everyone else without understanding what the reason is for it. Dyslexia is often hereditary, which is why there are often more people in the family who are dyslexic. It is important to note that dyslexia has no connection to intelligence, but can be referred to as a neurological inhibition in the phonological component of language. Dyslexics often need more time to read texts. This means e.g. that subtitles played on film go too fast, and the brain does not have enough time to work with the text to understand what it is saying before new subtitles appear on the screen. Therefore, it can be difficult to keep up with subtitles on film if you are dyslexic.",
      "p2": "5-8% of Denmark's population is estimated to be dyslexic, which means that there are about half a million people who have dyslexia in Denmark. However, everyone has different difficulties with his dyslexia and some are better at writing and others are better at reading. There are many different aids for dyslexia, and today there are also many apps for dyslexics. It makes everyday life easier and creates better conditions for people with dyslexia."
    },
    "q7": {
      "title": "What does it mean to have reading difficulties?",
      "p1": "Reading and writing difficulties can be due to things other than dyslexia. It can be difficult to follow the text and write correctly if you have a visual impairment or other disability. It can also be due to language understimulation, language impairment or lack of teaching. In addition, if you do not have Danish as a mother tongue, cultural differences and linguistic differences can make it difficult to understand Danish texts. Therefore, there are several different reasons why a child, a teenager or an adult has difficulty following subtitles on movies and series."
    },
    "q8": {
      "title": "What is challenging when you are dyslexic and how can you get help with dyslexia? bb",
      "p1": "As a dyslexic, reading a lot of text can be hard. It takes time to get the text to stick together, and you often risk reading sentences incorrectly, which means you do not understand the full context of the text. It can also be perceived as the letters jumping around in the sentences, or the text becoming blurred and unclear. Therefore, it is also difficult to keep up with the text that needs to be read quickly, e.g. by reading subtitles on movies that change quickly and move on to a new sentence when a new person speaks. It also makes it challenging to participate in certain social contexts such as cinema visits or movie nights with friends. This means that many who are dyslexic risk feeling left out when new movies and series are discussed between family and friends. Especially foreign films for which they can not read the subtitles. Many dyslexics learn English just like everyone else and can therefore watch foreign movies, even if they cannot read the subtitles.",
      "p2": "There are many aids for the dyslexic in the form of computer programs, reading rulers, but also apps. Some aids are supported by municipalities and schools, while others can be purchased privately. A speech therapist can help you choose good dyslexic aids and can recommend which tools are right for you. You can also search the internet for dyslexic aids. Since there are now many apps for the dyslexic, it is easy to try a few different aids and see which ones you like best.",
